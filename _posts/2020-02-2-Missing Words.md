I believe that having a good vocabulary is key to clear thinking. Sometimes I learn a new word and it clicks an idea into place that had just been waiting for the right description. 

Language has an amazing impact on how we think and act. 

With this in mind, I began to collect words that do not have a direct English translation. For one reason or another, these words exist in other languages, but are either too long, clunky, or not culturally relevant enough to have an English translation. 

## Japanese

[Tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku) (Japanese: 積ん読) is the habit of acquiring books but letting them pile up on dressers, shelves, and floors without reading them.

[Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) (生き甲斐, pronounced [ikiɡai]) is a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being".
