### Equity & Early Hiring
- When hiring early stage employess (first 10), do not hire for position fit; instead, hire "unreasonable" talent that will form the kitchen cabinet to drive the vision.
- Layer reasonable employees underneath this executive team that will microoptimize the product directly. 
- It is unintuitive, but highly worth it to be generous with equity to non-founder early employees. 
- Hire one or two early hires at 15% founder status that will be magnets to attract outside talent. 
- Give as much as 30% of the pool to non-founders. A good target for founder equity is 10% - 20%.
- Gene pool hiring engineering is to minimize the risks the company will face by virtue of building a strong team that will attract similar talent.
