Leaving our teeming cities is a struggle. A force of nature, they manufacture completely valid sounding reasons to postpone the trip away from civilization. Like removing a bandaid, it must be done quickly, and without hesitation.

Hearing stories about the ancient sequoias, I decided to see for myself. A bit of research shows the trees live to over 1,500 years on this earth. Approaching the base of an old man to the side of the trail, I struck out, suddenly cocky.

"With all your time you chose to simply grow straight up?"

To my surprise, I found myself filled with a response.

> "What are you planning to do with your 150 years that's so great?"

Abashed, I sat in his shade and thought about this.

I confessed, "It's actually much less than that."
