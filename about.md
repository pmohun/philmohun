Hello -- welcome to my website. This is a place for me to keep things that I wouldn't otherwise post publicly. Most posts and stories are musings to myself, but you might find them interesting too. 

I currently work in healthcare to design and implement blockchain technology. My goal is to offer simpler ways to deliver care. 

Apart from my professional life I enjoy winter sports, going to the beach, and spending time working on electronic and programming projects. If I'm not at home, check Gold's Gym in Venice, CA.

An invitation for a thoughtful discussion or a book recommendation will get my attention every time.

#### Contact

I am frequently traveling -- email is the best way to reach me.
