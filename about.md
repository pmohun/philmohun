** About ** 

Hello.

I am currently working in Anthem's Innovation Studio to help drive data based decisions and implement exponential technologies across the healthcare payer ecosystem. Coming from an engineering background I am familiar with the production and design of medical devices, specifically those used to monitor and track movement.

After graduating from Syracuse University with a B.S. Bioengineering, I moved to Los Angeles to expand my perspective and be closer to the technical innovation happening in Southern California. An avid technologist, I am energized when helping to build the infrastructure to enable widespread use of cognitive applications and artificial intelligence. 

Apart from my professional life, I enjoy winter sports (growing up in Buffalo, NY will do that), going to the beach, and spending time working on electronic and programming projects. If I'm not at home, check Gold's Gym in Venice, CA.

An invitation for a thoughtful discussion or a book recommendation will get my attention every time.

I am frequently traveling -- email is the best way to reach me.
